Hi, this is my journey. This is someone who once started software engineering
but I hit a road block in my learning journey and that was it, I did try picking it up
but Ive fallen many times in the journey. I've done python before, couldn't go pass
OOP, although I know the basics, I know I'm rusty and I'm taking it again. Yh so this is a 
journey, this time being intentional and yh, I will be updating this from time to time. 4-11-25 8.28 PM
